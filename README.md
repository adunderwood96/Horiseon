# Code Refactor Starter Code: Horiseon 

This website challange was developed and edited in order to better understand how to code HTML, CSS, and Git with accessability in mind. I refactored the code from a starter code with feature request from the "client" by optimizing and deleating duplicate styles, as well as changing the stylesheet to flow better with following the HTML layout.
